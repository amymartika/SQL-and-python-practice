# Challenge: Say "Hello, World!" With Python
# print("Hello, World!") 

print("Hello, World!") 

# Challenge: Arithmetic Operators
# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. 
# Add code to print three lines where: 
# 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. 
# 2. The second line contains the difference of the first two numbers (first minus second). 
# 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)

# Challenge: Python: Division
# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN. 
# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. 
# The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b. 

print(a // b)
print(a / b)

# Challenge: Loops
# The provided code stub reads an integer, n, from STDIN. 
# For all non-negative integers i < n, print i squared. 
# Print n lines, one corresponding to each i. 

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    n = int(input()) 
    
for i in range(n): 
    print(i * i)

# Challenge: Write a function
# Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. 
# If it is a leap year, return the Boolena True. 
# Otherwise, return False.

    else: 
        leap = False
    return leap

# Challenge: Print Function
# The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN. 
# Without using any string methods, try to print the following: 123...n
# Example: if n is 5, output should be 12345.
