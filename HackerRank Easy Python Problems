## Challenge: Say "Hello, World!" With Python
## print("Hello, World!") 

print("Hello, World!") 

## Challenge: Arithmetic Operators
## The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. 
## Add code to print three lines where: 
## 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. 
## 2. The second line contains the difference of the first two numbers (first minus second). 
## 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)

## Challenge: Python: Division
## The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN. 
## Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. 
## The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b. 

print(a // b)
print(a / b)
